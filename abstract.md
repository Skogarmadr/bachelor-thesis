Atomic swaps are practical for exchanging different cryptocurrencies in avoiding any trusted third-parties. This project shows a swap between Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain using payment channels tools like hashlock or timelock. When the protocol is followed by both participants, it guarantees that the swap will either go ahead without any risk or be aborted. Furthermore, there is no scenario where someone can control both parties coins, therefore the entire swap process is non-custodial in nature.
