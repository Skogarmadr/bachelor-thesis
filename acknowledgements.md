First and foremost, I would like to express my big thanks to Thomas Shababi to be my co-advisor and the initiator of this thesis. Despite his work, he has always found the time to assist and collaborate with me in this project from the beginning. He is also an excellent source of knowledge in blockchain as much as a developer. It was a great opportunity for me to meet him.

Secondly, I would like to thanks my professor Marina Ninoslav, for his kindness and understanding of being my mentor all this year. I learned a lot from him with his support; his experience and valuable feedback on the thesis. I would express my gratitude to him for motivating me to continue in the blockchain.

Finally, I would also like to thank all the TrueLevel team for their help, especially Thomas Roulin, who has to take the time to help me several times but also Jacques Dafflon and Joel Gr√ºgger. Without forgetting to express my special thanks to Nicolas Huguenin, without this character, all that would never have happened.
