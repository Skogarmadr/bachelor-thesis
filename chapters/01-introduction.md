# Introduction

## Motivation
Firstly, the main problem when two parties want to exchange some goods is the problem of trust. For dealing an exchange that works, we need a certain level of trust must be apply. Particularly, when the transaction depends by no one. To illustrate this, we cannot simply assure that a party A will get a good after paying some money to a party B and vice versa. A trusted third party or escrow may resolve this problem to arbitrate a transaction without no one try to swindle the other. But in compensation for this, an extra cost may be added to the transaction and there is still no guarantee that the escrow is a trusted source. Secondly, the most of crypto-based exchanges are still fully centralized even though the main goal of cryptocurrencies is to create a decentralized system of finance. When two parties would like to exchange two different coins, they must pass by a crypto-fund commerce but these platform remain in generally exclusively of the main centralized exchanges. Anyone who uses these exchanges may potentially risks a various of additionnal problems like inherent risk of being hacked, or having a breach of user confidentiality, somes delays etc... To figure there problems out, the necessity of an implementation of cross-chain payments or atomic swap has been made for assuring a trustless and decentralized system that exists authorizing the blockchain application to interact with another blockchain.
