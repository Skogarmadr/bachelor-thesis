# Introduction

## Motivation
Firstly, the main problem when two parties want to exchange some goods is the problem of
trust. For dealing with an exchange that works, we need a certain level of trust must apply particularly when the transaction depends on no one. To illustrate this, we cannot simply assure that a party A will get a good after paying some money to a party B and vice versa. A trusted third party or escrow may resolve this problem to arbitrate a transaction without no
one try to swindle the other. But in compensation for this, an extra cost may be added to
the transaction and there is still no guarantee that the escrow is a trusted source. Secondly, most of the crypto-based exchanges are still fully centralized even though the main goal of
cryptocurrencies is to create a decentralized system of finance. When two parties would
like to exchange two different coins, they must pass by crypto-fund commerce but these
platforms remain in generally exclusively of the main centralized exchanges. Anyone who
uses these exchanges may potentially risk various additional problems like an inherent
risk of being hacked or having a breach of user confidentiality, some delays, and many other
problems. To figure these problems out, the necessity of implementation of cross-chain
payments or atomic swap has been made for assuring a trustless and decentralized system
that exists, authorizing the blockchain application to interact with another blockchain.


## Purpose of the thesis

Our objective is to understand the conception of the cross-chain swap, to know how it works and to implement an example of an atomic swap with two actors. The cryptocurrencies chosen for this project are Bitcoin and Ethereum both the most common and different blockchains. For making the success of the project, we need to master how both cryptographic currencies work if we want to program and develop software that implements them. The main goal of this thesis is not to have a product made for the production but instead create more educational work from scratch allowing the understanding of all the important concepts from the blockchain world.

## Challenge

Programming on a blockchain for developing programs is not an easy task. Programming on two different blockchains at the same time is worse especially when we do not know about it. Every blockchain has its lot of features to take into account even they have also several similarities, which they deviate from the standard way of thinking in software development. The main goal here is to explain the atomic swap method that must be generic and therefore can be easily understandable and used by a large number of people. The best approach to handle this challenge is to gather all the knowledge we can get and just start to code. Practices make perfect.
