In this chapter, we analyze the benefit of the atomic swap for in comparison standard platform of exchange. We analyze also certain result of the implementation that can be review for an improvement. 

## Benefits of the Atomic swap

## Limitation of the atomic swap

## Problem of the block explorer
The project is functional by using the combination of centralized and decentralized components. For getting the data from the blockchains, we need to use a block explorer. A block explorer is a centralized tool that provides a view of cryptocurrency transactions online. UNfortunately this technic has some issues, the main issue is that we are dependant of the block explorer. That means if we cannot get information from it, our program is unusable. To resolves this issues for getting the data we can run our own node of each blockchain in local. It is the best approach for being decentralized and especially not depending from a third party. However we sacrifice the user friendly of our program, because that's need for each user who wants use our program to install and run also a node in local into his computer. This step can complicated for some users and  even they can be lost for using our programs. It is why we have prefer to keep block explorer, the users has the minimum of task and we conserve the interface user-friendly.
