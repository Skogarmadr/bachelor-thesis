## Conclusion

Atomic swaps allow us to exchanges different cryptocurrencies between two peers. To be trustless and decentralized, we described all requirements throughout this thesis, by a protocol specifically made for Bitcoin and Ethereum. In this thesis, we have focused on the explanations of the mechanism in Bitcoin and Ethereum Blockchain, then by the atomic swap protocol. We wanted to show, for respecting the protocol, we need to respect some requirements. Although the project works, the atomic swap technology is still fairly new, and limitations exist. This technology is driving significant changes in regards to blockchain interoperability and cross-chain trading capabilities. However, we focus on these lacks, and we succeed in the improvement of one of the inconveniences of blockchain,  scalability problems. Indeed, we put an extra effort for making our program compatible with \gls{gls-segwit} transaction by using \gls{p2wsh} instead of the basic \gls{p2sh} in bitcoin transaction.
This project is a proof of work, to show that this technology offers many benefits for crypto investors who want to diversify their coins. As we have seen, the exchange is a low cost, faster, and a secure alternative, and it is also possible to resolve some issues from this protocol for better usage. However, we want to notice that all cryptocurrencies cannot be exchanged together in this thesis. Finally, Atomic Swap offers new potential for defining the way we trade in online exchange platforms. Maybe in the future, it can revolutionize online crypto trading that suffers today of several issues. 


## Perspective

Our project represents a centralized web app where users can swap different cryptocurrencies. Although it is centralized, there is no counterpart risk.  It is better than the existing platform of exchange full centralized that comprises vulnerabilities and no trustless. However, it is not enough yet. As we have shown, the result of this limited centralization is a lack of guaranteed availability, whereas the smart contracts provide consistency and persistence. If we want to mitigate the risk of users who have an open swap, we can think about downloading the web app into the client's computers. This solution should ensure redundancies in the 3rd party API, even integrating a light client or SVP.
